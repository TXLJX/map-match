# map-match
##Based on two pairs of image matching, select two points on each of the two geographic images

Use selected points to handle possible rotations as well as graphics precision, s scaling issues

//Note that it is three clicks but only the first two clicks
choicePoints = ginput(3)

I also added some code for the SIFI algorithm.
